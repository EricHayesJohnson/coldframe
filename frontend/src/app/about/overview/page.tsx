        Coldframe is a telemetry system that began with a box in my garden. I
        put sensors on it. That box became the project&apos;s namesake.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started there has grown into a full data pipeline with dedicated
        hardware, APIs, and a real-time monitoring dashboard. Along the way, the
        project pushed me into unfamiliar territory: soldering circuits,
        building enclosures, writing firmware. Each stretched the initial
        concept into something I hadn&apos;t fully planned for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The deeper I&apos;ve gone, the more gardening and engineering seem to
        operate on similar principles. Both reward systems-level thinking and
        run on cycles of observation and adjustment. Act, measure, refine,
        repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coldframe lives in that space, still growing. Future iterations will
        explore mechanical garden automation, microclimate analytics, and things
        I haven&apos;t yet considered. Maybe something technical, who knows,
        maybe something creative. For now, I&apos;m watching to see what
        emerges.
