        Coldframe grew out of the desire to combine two things that deeply
        interest me, home gardening and building software. The name pays homage
        to the project&apos;s humble roots.

        What began as a simple prototype has turned into a full ecosystem, from
        soldering and sealing enclosures to writing firmware, designing APIs and
        styling UIs.

        Gardening rewards systems thinking, so it pairs very naturally with
        engineering. I plan to keep exploring that overlap: connecting more
        sensors, layering automation, and through experimentation learning what
        it takes to build a dependable real-world system.
